#### this is to demonstrate how encryption algorithms work in a simplified real world senario using RSA pubic cryptographic algorithm

this was my computer network security course simple project, i hope it will give you a better undersanding on how encryption is done over a network. 
the code needs no explanation, its pretty much self explanatory code, in addition i have added adequate comments to help you understand better.

### here is how to do the demo
- first clone the repo, if you don't know how to clone then what are you doing here!ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤” 
- run the server code first
```
python server.py
```
- and then run the client
```
python client.py
```
- install and run wireshark 
- then if you are using ```localhost``` choose loopback traffic on the Capture section or if you are using vmware check your vmnet type.
- then chat

- after that you can see the captured and decoded packets on wireshark
